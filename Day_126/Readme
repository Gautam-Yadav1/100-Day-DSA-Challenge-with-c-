Find the majority element in the array. A majority element in an array A[] of size n is an element that appears more than n/2 times (and hence there is at most one such element). 

Examples : 

Input : A[]={3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4}
Output : 4
Explanation: The frequency of 4 is 5 which is greater than the half of the size of the array size. 

Input : A[] = {3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4}
Output : No Majority Element
Explanation: There is no element whose frequency is greater than the half of the size of the array size.

Time Complexity: O(n*n), A nested loop is needed where both the loops traverse the array from start to end.
Auxiliary Space: O(1), No extra space is required.
