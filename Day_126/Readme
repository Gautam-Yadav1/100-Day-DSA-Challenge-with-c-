Let’s start!

To Show You Some Instances
Instance-1
Suppose the original array is {16, 17, 4, 3, 11, 14, 23, 2, 6, 10}.
After finding leaders in an array the result will be − 23 10

Instance-2
Suppose the original array is {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 6, 9, 1, 8, 2}.
After finding leaders in an array the result will be − 17 9 8 2

Instance-3
Suppose the original array is {1, 5, 7, 3, 2, 1}
After finding leaders in an array the result will be − 7 1
